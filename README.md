### Hi there 👋

I'm Paul, a Data Scientist with a background in physics, mathematics, and coding.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on planning a new project. Details to come.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more than about project planning and management.
- 👨‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on making the world a better place.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, and if I don't have the answer, I'll find it.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Creative writing is an outlet for some of my more speculative ideas.
